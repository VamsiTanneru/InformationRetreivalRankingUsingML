## 1. Overview <a name="overview"></a>

This project focuses on developing an Intelligent Information Retrieval System using a hybrid approach combining Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The system aims to address the ranking challenges in information retrieval, improving accuracy and efficiency.

## 2. Features <a name="features"></a>

- **Query Formulation and Preprocessing:** Utilizes relevance feedback and various operations for both single and multiple-term queries.
- **Document Feature Extraction:** Extracts low-level, high-level, hyperlink, and hybrid features for efficient ranking.
- **Ranking Algorithm:** Implements a ranking system based on SVM and PSO for monolingual documents.

## 3. Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

### 3.1 Software <a name="software"></a>
- Python 3
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook

### 3.2 Hardware <a name="hardware"></a>
- System: Pentium Dual Core
- Hard Disk: 120 GB
- Monitor: 14" and above LED
- RAM: 1GB

## 4. Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>

The system follows a structured approach for information retrieval using SVM and PSO. The process involves preprocessing raw documents and queries, converting words to vectors, and applying clustering. The SVM classifier is used for document classification, and PSO optimization is employed for ranking.

## 5. Evaluation <a name="evaluation"></a>

Performance is evaluated based on Recall, Precision, F1-score, and Accuracy metrics. Experimental results indicate improved ranking for single and multiple-term queries compared to individual SVM and PSO methods.

## 6. Usage <a name="usage"></a>

1. Install Anaconda and Python 3.
2. Open the project in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the code and comments for implementation details.

## 7. Conclusion and Future Scope <a name="conclusion-and-future-scope"></a>

This hybrid system demonstrates enhanced performance in information retrieval. Future improvements may include extending the system for cross-lingual support, real-time retrieval, and integration with advanced machine learning models.
